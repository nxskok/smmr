```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(smmr)
```


test data frame

```{r}
d=tibble(g=factor(c("a","a","b","b","c","c")),x=10:15)
d
```

```{r}
median_test(d,x,g)
```

works, as it should

```{r}
pairwise_median_test(d,x,g)
```

NaNs

```{r}
median_test_pair(d,x,g,"a","b")
```

problem is that g as a factor has *three* levels even if you only look at two of them

```{r}
d %>% filter(g=="a" | g=="b") %>% 
  median_test(x, g) 
```

and this kills chisq.test

```{r}
d %>% filter(g=="a" | g=="b") %>% 
  median_test(x, as.character(g)) 

```

that cracks it

did the function get updated?

```{r}
median_test_pair
```

no
